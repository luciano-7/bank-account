This program allows the user to set up a bank account with user defined account balance and annual interest rate. Then it creates two accounts, one checking and one savings, and allows the user to deposit or withdraw from the selected account. It also lets the user see the stats of the account for the month. When monthlyProc and stats are checked, it acts as if a month had passed.
